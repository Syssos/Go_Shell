# Commands

This package is the break and butter of the Go Shell. This will be responsible for starting the command input loop. Parsing arguments or input to the shell to execute commands with flags, and of course executing the commands.

This package is in it's early stages of life. It is intended to be an easy "Skeleton" for me to adapt into other projects that may benifit from a shell based feature. The structure is still changing as the core needs are introduced. After which things will be easier to sort and manage.
