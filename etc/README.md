# etc
This directory is included in the repository to include example, images, or other forms of data a user may find helpful. Below will be a brief description of what you may find within this folder.

## example_log.txt
This file is an example for the logger. It's sole purpose is demonstrating the output of a log file.

## hostme_test.html
The `hostme` command will allow a user to host a single html file on a web server running on localhost. To test this feature the hostme_test.html file was created to use during the process.

Viewing this file can be done via the host me command by running the following.

```
$ hostme settings/hostme_test.html
```
## images/
The images folder does not contain a readme, because its only purpose is to store images used by other readme's.

## Revero/
Revero is a web application created with the help of a pond. It reverses a string entered into the form. This project is included in etc as an example on how a pond can be used quickly to perform some sort of task that takes input from a user and sends back modified data.

While this is a relatively simple example on how ponds can be used. It outlines a way to start taking advantage of them.
