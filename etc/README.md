# etc
This directory is home of all things etc...

## contents
Within the folders and files contained in this directory are all the "small" things that make the shell as a whole work how it should. Containing files for the pond command to generate ponds, and settings files for the logger is its only purpose.

These files will get moved into a specific location($HOME/.gofsh) during install.

These files will be refrenced from commands so not having them on the local machine can cause the program to function incorrectly.
